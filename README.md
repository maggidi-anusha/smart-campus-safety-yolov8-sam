# Smart Campus Safety Detection Using YOLOv8 & SAM

This project aims to automate campus safety monitoring by detecting and segmenting
safety equipment such as helmets, gloves, and masks in real-time using deep learning.

## Objectives
- Detect campus safety equipment using YOLOv8
- Perform pixel-level segmentation using Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- Provide real-time monitoring through a Streamlit web interface

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- OpenCV
- Streamlit

## Project Status
Phase 1 completed: Project setup and planning
